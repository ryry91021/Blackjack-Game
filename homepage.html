            <h2>How to Play Blackjack</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Card Values:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
                <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</li>
                <li>Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initial Deal:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards.</li>
                        <li>Players' cards are usually dealt face up, while one of the dealer's cards is face up (upcard), and the other is face down (hole card).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Player's Turn:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Players decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).</li>
                        <li>Players can continue to hit until they decide to stand or until their hand exceeds 21, resulting in a bust.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dealer's Turn:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once all players have completed their turn, the dealer reveals their hole card.</li>
                        <li>The dealer must hit until their hand reaches at least 17 points.</li>
                        <li>If the dealer busts, players who haven't busted win.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The player with a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.</li>
                        <li>If a player has blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) and the dealer doesn't, the player usually receives a higher payout.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
